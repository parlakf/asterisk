oufxs is a Dahdi-compatible (or Dahdi-compliant, if
you prefer) driver for the Open USB FXS board. To
try this out, you must have an Open USB FXS board
available. For details on the project and on how
to get a board (when boards become available to the
public), please refer to the project's blog at the
URL http://openusbfxs.wordpress.com/ .


In order to compile and install this module, you must
first place this directory inside the Dahdi source
code distribution. If your dahdi source is located in
say, /usr/src/dahdi-2.x.y.z/, then place this directory
in /usr/src/dahdi-2.x.y.z/drivers/dahdi/oufxs (or, if
you prefer, create a new directory named
/usr/src/dahdi-2.x.y.z/drivers/dahdi/oufxs and copy
the contents of the current directory in the newly
created one).

To compile the module, you may try one of the following:

Method 1:
  $ cd  /usr/src/dahdi-2.x.y.z/drivers/dahdi/oufxs
  $ make

This may or may not work for you. It really depends on
the Kbuild environment in your kernel.


Method 2 (suggested):
  $ cd /usr/src/dahdi-2.x.y.z
  $ make SUBDIRS_EXTRA+=oufxs/

This works on most environments.

Ubuntu uses the dkms system, so you must fiddle with the
file dkms.conf (found in /usr/src/dahdi-2.x.y.z/) and
add the "SUBDIRS_EXTRA+=oufxs/" in the make commands in
dkms.conf.

If you are compiling against dahdi 2.3.x or 2.4.x, please
note that the channel persistence feature triggers a bug
in dahdi, whereby oufxs may remain locked in the kernel.
To fix, please patch ../dahdi-base.c using the provided
patch file dahdi-base-2.3+.patch before compiling. As of
today (Dec. 2010), there is no official patch from Digium
that fixes this issue. For further information and updates,
